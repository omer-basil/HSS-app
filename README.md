<h2>REST API</h2>
<p>
The project includes a REST API for interacting with the application's data. This allows for easy integration with other systems and applications. The API is built in accordance with REST principles and makes use of common HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
</p>
<h2>Multi-Auth</h2>
<p>
The project utilises the spatie-permission package for handling authentication and authorisation. This allows for the creation of multiple types of users, each with their own set of permissions and abilities. User roles can be easily managed and assigned through the package's built-in functions.
</p>
<h2>Tagging</h2>
<p>
The project includes a tagging system that allows for easy categorisation of data within the application. This can be useful for organising and searching for specific items.
</p>
<h2>Order Email Confirmation</h2>
<p>
Upon placing an order, the user will receive an email confirmation containing details of the order. This helps to ensure that the user has a record of their purchase and can easily reference it if needed.
